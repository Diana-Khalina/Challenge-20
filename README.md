# Challenge-20
# AutoQuizActions
 This project using continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment (CI/CD) into an existing quiz application. The application, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), allows users to take a tech quiz, view random questions, and see their score at the end.

## Features
- **Component Testing**: Verifies individual Quiz component, ensuring it functions correctly in isolation.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Simulates the full user journey from starting the quiz to viewing the final score, ensuring the app works as intended.
- **CI/CD**: Testing is completed and passed before the code is merged with main and deployed to the live production environment using GitHub Actions
